Codes used in preprint "Stochastic effects on the establishment of mutants resistant to Î²-lactam antibiotics"


Description of codes.

Codes are written in python. Can be compiled and run from terminal with command -- python *filename* 


Code: data-fitting-code-mechanistic-multiple-different-n.py

Fits data with same n for both media. Data to be fitted is contained in the file. 
Output plots are produced. Output data for fitting curves are printed.
